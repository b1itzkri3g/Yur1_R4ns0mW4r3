# Ransomware Attacks vs. Anti-Ransomware Solutions in a Lab Environment

---

## Project Overview

**Objective:**

To assess the effectiveness of an anti-ransomware defense tool in detecting and mitigating the impact of a ransomware attack. This project simulates a ransomware infection within a controlled environment to determine whether the defender tool can prevent or limit the attack's damage.

---

## Methodology

### Step 1: Determine and Justify the Threat Type

**Chosen Threat Type:** Ransomware

**Justification:**

Ransomware is one of the most damaging cyber threats, capable of encrypting critical files and demanding a ransom for decryption. This threat affects organizations worldwide, leading to financial and data losses. Evaluating anti-ransomware tools is critical in understanding how well they can protect systems from file encryption, data theft, and other impacts of ransomware attacks.

### Step 2: Attacker and Defender Tool Selection

| **Tool Type** | **Tool Name** | **Description** | **Justification** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Attacker Tool** | Yur1 Ransomware | A ransomware simulator designed to mimic real-world ransomware behavior by encrypting files without permanent damage. | Ensures lab safety while accurately representing ransomware tactics (e.g., file encryption, system recovery inhibition). |
| **Defender Tool** | Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware | Provides real-time protection against ransomware via heuristic and behavior-based detection. | Widely used for ransomware defense; critical for testing detection speed and mitigation effectiveness. |

**Comparison Criteria:**

1. **Detection Speed:** Time taken to detect ransomware activity.
2. **Mitigation Effectiveness:** Ability to block encryption and restore files.
3. **Resource Usage:** System performance impact during monitoring.

---

### Step 3: Proposed Testing Scenario

**Scenario:** Simulate ransomware attacks on a lab machine, first without defenses, then with Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware enabled.

**Steps:**

1. **Baseline Test (No Defense):**
    - Execute the ransomware simulator.
    - Measure file encryption rate and system recovery limitations.
2. **Apply Anti-Ransomware Defense:**
    - Enable Malwarebytes and rerun the simulator.
    - Observe detection alerts and blocking success.
3. **Compare Results:**
    - Evaluate encryption prevention and file restoration capabilities.

### Step 4: Map to MITRE ATT&CK Techniques

| **MITRE Technique** | **Relevance** |
| --- | --- |
| **T1486** (Data Encrypted for Impact) | Simulates ransomware file encryption to render data unusable. |
| **T1490** (Inhibit System Recovery) | Mimics ransomware deletion of backups/restoration options. |
| **T1059** (Command and Scripting Interpreter) | Tests use of scripts for encryption commands. |

---

### Step 5: Define Success Metrics

**Without Defense:**

- **Encryption Rate:** Percentage of files encrypted.
- **Recovery Difficulty:** Ability to restore data without backups.

**With Anti-Ransomware Defense:**

- **Detection Rate:** Alerts generated during attack simulation.
- **Blocking Success Rate:** Prevention of file encryption.
- **File Restoration:** Recovery of partially encrypted files.

**Success Criteria:**

- **Attacker Success:** Files encrypted and system recovery disabled without defense.
- **Defender Success:** Ransomware blocked or mitigated with minimal data loss.

---

### Step 6: Deploy Lab Environment

**Testing Environment Setup:**

- Virtual machine with simulated user files.
- Install yur1 ransomware simulator.

**Testing Phases:**

1. **Baseline Ransomware Test (No Defense):**
    - Execute simulator and record encryption impact.
2. **Anti-Ransomware Defense Test:**
    - Install Malwarebytes and rerun simulator.
    - Log detection alerts and file integrity post-attack.

---

### Step 7: Analyze and Compare Results

**Without Defense:**

- Track file encryption extent and system downtime.
- Document challenges in data recovery.

**With Anti-Ransomware Defense:**

- Evaluate detection speed and blocking accuracy.
- Assess system stability and file restoration options.

---

### Step 8: Evaluate Against Real-World Applications

**Relevance:**

- Ransomware attacks are a global threat to organizations.
- Anti-ransomware tools are critical for preventing data loss and financial damage.

**Risk Assessment:**

- Lack of defenses leads to operational downtime, ransom payments, and reputational harm.

---

### Step 9: Map to Essential 8 Mitigations

| **Essential 8 Mitigation** | **Application** |
| --- | --- |
| **Daily Backups** | Ensures encrypted data can be restored without ransom payments. |
| **Application Control** | Blocks unauthorized execution of ransomware scripts. |
| **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** | Secures privileged accounts to limit ransomware propagation. |
